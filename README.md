## 🤔 My process

### 🏗️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Query

### 🧠 What I learned

Basically learned how to apply media query function to my website to be responsible.

This it what I'm proud of learning in this challenge:

```css
@media screen and (max-width:600px) {
    .container {
        width: 288px;
        margin: 100px auto;}}
```

### 👩‍💻 Useful resources

- [5 Reasons Why Your CSS Media Queries Are NOT Working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqN6atXVAE) - This video helped me because I was stuck trying to make @media function to work. Solution was in the position of meta tag on the bottom of the list on the head html.
